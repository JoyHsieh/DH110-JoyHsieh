# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Joy Hsieh, DH110
## Tentative Title: Senior Stories
Throughout the years, I've heard tidbits of stories from my grandparents. As they get older, I realize how precious the time I have left with them is. **i will add more text here!**

In this assignment, I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two websites with goals similar to the ones of this project. The first, TimeSlips, allows seniors to write creative stories. The second, Simply Life Stories, provides a guide to recording your own life story. The evaluation will discuss each site's adherence to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and provide [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)

#### Background Information
TimeSlips is an organization with a mission to "Bring meaning and purpose into the lives of elders through creative engagement". The main goal is to allow seniors to write creative stories. To do this, users can make an account for free, go to their "Creativity Center", and select a prompt to follow. From there, users can type their story in a text box or upload a photo of a written response. The website also has extensive information on what TimeSlips is, services that they provide, resources, news, and ways to get involved with the organization.
