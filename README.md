# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Joy Hsieh, DH110
## Tentative Title: Senior Stories
Throughout the years, I've heard tidbits of stories from my grandparents and their siblings. My grandma got into college by going on a hunger strike to pressure her parents into letting her attend. My grandpa grew up in Taiwan during the martial law period and performed mandatory military service. My great aunt was a single mother and a flight attendant, at a time when not many women supported themselves and their children independently.

As my grandparents have gotten older, I've felt a great desire to capture as many stories from their lives as I can so that they may be preserved and retold to future generations of our family. I want to contribute with this UX project by creating a website or app that people like my grandparents can go to and record their life stories.

In this assignment, I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two websites with goals similar to the ones of this project. The first, TimeSlips, allows seniors to write creative stories. The second, The Life Writer, provides a way for seniors to write a memoir book. The evaluation will discuss each site's adherence to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and provide [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) with consideration for the target users, senior citizens.

#### Background Information
TimeSlips is an organization with a mission to help seniors to write creative stories. To do this, users can make an account, go to their "Creativity Center", and select a prompt to follow. From there, users can type their story in a text box or upload a photo of a written response. The website also has extensive information on what TimeSlips is, services that they provide, resources, news, and ways to get involved with the organization.
#### Heuristic Evaluation
_Overall Evaluation_: The website is not tailored for a senior citizen to use themselves, but for someone such as a younger family member or a caretaker to navigate for them.

| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website clearly informs the user about its current status                                                                            | **Good**: The site gives a pop up message to tell the user when they have successfully signed in or out, when their story has been successfully saved, etc.<br>**Good**: The site clearly lets the user know if they are logged in or logged out in the upper right corner.<br>**Bad**: The site lets the user know where they are on the site by highlighting the menu option, but it isn't always obvious becuase some menu options are nestled within others. | Highlight both the main menu option and sub-menu option so users can easily know exactly where on the site they are.                                                                | 2                         |

These menu options collapse into a sidebar with three lines when the window width is narrow.<br>**Good**: Clicking on "TimeSlips" on the top of any page takes the user back to the home page.<br>**Bad**: The sidebar menu is a standard convention, but may be more difficult for seniors to navigate than having options available at the top of the page.                 | Leave the menu options at the top no matter what the screen width is or replace the three lines that indicate menu say "Menu" instead.                                              | 3                         |
