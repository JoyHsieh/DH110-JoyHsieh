# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation - Joy Hsieh, DH110
## Tentative Title: Senior Stories
Throughout the years, I've heard tidbits of stories from my grandparents and their siblings. My grandma got into college by going on a hunger strike to pressure her parents into letting her attend. My grandpa grew up in Taiwan during the martial law period and performed mandatory military service. My great aunt was a single mother and a flight attendant, at a time when not many women supported themselves and their children independently.

As my grandparents have gotten older, I've felt a great desire to capture as many stories from their lives as I can so that they may be preserved and retold to future generations of our family. I want to contribute with this UX project by creating a website or app that people like my grandparents can go to and record their life stories.

In this assignment, I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two websites with goals similar to the ones of this project. The first, TimeSlips, allows seniors to write creative stories. The second, The Life Writer, provides a way for seniors to write a memoir book. The evaluation will discuss each site's adherence to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and provide [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) with consideration for the target users, senior citizens.

When the user is done, the book can be downloaded or printed. This website also feautures a background on The Life Writer, an example book, blog, and testimonials.
